    <p>Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a programmer who specializes in functional programming (particularly Haskell).</p>

    <p>
        I'm currently taking a sabbatical and exploring how alternative computer-network architectures can
        facilitate richer forms of organizational structures and "group subjects" (where many ostensibly-separate
        agents act together as a single agential entity).
    </p>

    <p>
        from late 2022 to mid-2024, I worked on
        <a href="posts/2025-01-02-on-plunder.html">Plunder</a>
        as a prospective foundation on which to build distributed, alternative economic tooling.
    </p>

    <p>
        From 2020 to late 2022, I worked on distributed reputation economic tooling for
        <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/">Neighbourhoods</a>. My contributions focused on the interpreter for their
        <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/rep_lang"><i>reputation language</i></a>
        and
        <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/social_sensemaker/"><i>its integration with Holochain</i></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        From 2018 to 2020, I worked as a Haskell Developer at
        <a href="https://iohk.io/">IOHK</a>, contributing to the
        <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node">Cardano blockchain system</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        From 2014 to 2016, I worked at
        <a href="https://galois.com">Galois</a>, building applied research prototypes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before that, I studied Computer Science at Northwestern University, specializing in programming language
        theory & functional programming. I conducted a few research projects with
        <a href="https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~robby/">Robby Findler</a>.
