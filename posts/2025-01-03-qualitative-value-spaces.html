        <p>(WIP)</p>
<p>I’d like to restate the core suggestion of <a href="2025-01-02-embedding-sharing-llm-economies.html">y’day’s post</a>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>value is qualitative</strong></li>
<li><strong>LLMs embed qualities in quantitative vector spaces</strong></li>
<li><strong>quantitative representations are communicable across computer networks</strong></li>
<li><strong>lateral federation supports decentralization</strong></li>
<li><strong>‘embedding alignment’ can support decentralized value-coherence</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>and now, expanding on the above:</p>
<h2 id="value-is-qualitative">1: value is qualitative</h2>
<p>this is largely based on / borrowing from Massumi’s <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517905873/99-theses-on-the-revaluation-of-value/">99 theses</a>.</p>
<p>captitalism conditions us to prioritize the quantitative scalarized money-commodity over all else.
it is our “yardstick” by which we measure and commensurate all things.</p>
<p>Massumi encourages us to explore value’s qualitative aspects, and (imo) suggests that the most important aspects of value are qualitative.</p>
<h2 id="llms-embed-qualities-in-quantitative-vector-spaces">2: LLMs embed qualities in quantitative vector spaces</h2>
<p>this seems self-evident.
LLMs are strange and we perhaps do not understand exactly what they are doing, but they seem to have impressive ability to grasp “qualities”.</p>
<p>under the hood, they use a highly quantitative representation - high dimensional vector spaces with no intrinsic “qualitative meanings”.
yet they are able to “embed qualities” into these spaces.</p>
<h2 id="quantitative-representations-are-communicable-across-computer-networks">3: quantitative representations are communicable across computer networks</h2>
<p>obviously, quantized digital data can be easily transmitted.</p>
<p>text, one quantized representation, is often used to communicate qualities between humans and machines.
yet, some of the meaning is often lost in the “game of telephone”.</p>
<p>quantized vector-space representations could communicate complex qualities across computer networks without loss via encoding+decoding through text.</p>
<h2 id="lateral-federation-supports-decentralization">4: lateral federation supports decentralization</h2>
<p>scale exerts a homogenizing &amp; fungible-izing effect on what it touches.
for example, labor markets commoditize and fungible-ize humans.
imo, the dehumanizing effects of working a corporate job are connected to this.</p>
<p>small-scale collectives are better able to support the needs of their uniquely-individual constituents.</p>
<p>yet, large-scale coordination is necessary.
lateral federation between small-scale collectives seems a desirable alternative to vertical large-scale, and better supports decentralization.</p>
<p>decentralization is desirable because it supports the preservation of each collective’s culture.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-alignment-can-support-decentralized-value-coherence">5: ‘embedding alignment’ can support decentralized value-coherence</h2>
<p>imo, coordination of many small-scale entities has proved challenging and is perhaps the main reason why decentralization efforts are failing.
vertical large-scale is more effective at coordination, perhaps largely due to its use of a “single central value-representation”.</p>
<p>if there are numerous LLM-centered collectives, each with their distinct flavor of “qualitative valuation”, how can they coordinate and interoperate with each other? how can they hope to challenge the efficiencies of vertical large-scale?</p>
<p>perhaps <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13688">‘embedding alignment’</a> offers hope. if qualitative value-representations can be aligned between different decentralized quality-collectives, it seems possible that lateral federation could achieve sufficient coordination-efficiency to be competitive.</p>
