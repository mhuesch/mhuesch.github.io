        <p>Imagine a world where local communities, or <em>collectives</em>, manage their resources and energy flows autonomously, guided by shared values and cultural priorities. In this vision, technology doesn’t dominate; it empowers. Large Language Models (LLMs) become the cooperative tools of a post-capitalist society, enabling coordination without markets, competition, or exploitation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-todays-systems">The Problem with Today’s Systems</h2>
<p>Global economic systems often reduce communities to abstract units in a market, prioritizing profit over people and the planet. This erodes local autonomy and homogenizes culture. Coordination between communities happens through markets or centralized bureaucracies—systems ill-suited to fostering equity and sustainability.</p>
<h2 id="enter-llm-based-local-economies">Enter LLM-Based Local Economies</h2>
<p>What if every collective had its own AI-powered system to manage its “local economy”? An LLM tailored to their values, culture, and needs could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track resources like food, energy, and materials.</li>
<li>Help balance sustainability with the well-being of the community.</li>
<li>Suggest equitable ways to share surpluses or meet shortages.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not some top-down AI dystopia. These systems would work collaboratively with human decision-makers, acting as facilitators and record-keepers rather than authoritarian managers.</p>
<h2 id="coordination-without-markets">Coordination Without Markets</h2>
<p>As collectives grow and interact, they need a way to “speak the same language” while respecting their differences. This is where cutting-edge AI techniques like <strong>shared embedding spaces</strong> come into play. Collectives can exchange information through aligned representations, enabling them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand each other’s needs and surpluses.</li>
<li>Coordinate directly without relying on price signals or monetary transactions.</li>
<li>Respect local cultures while forming networks of solidarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s like having a universal translator for economies—one that works on principles of cooperation rather than competition.</p>
<h2 id="federation-without-homogenization">Federation Without Homogenization</h2>
<p>This approach allows for lateral growth. Collectives can join federations where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each maintains its autonomy and cultural identity.</li>
<li>Shared AI systems align their resource flows for mutual benefit.</li>
<li>Coordination scales naturally, without centralized control.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a vision of growth through connection, not conquest.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-start">How We Start</h2>
<p>Building such a system starts small:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Prototype Local Systems</strong>: Using open-source AI, we can simulate resource flows and decision-making in a hypothetical collective.</li>
<li><strong>Simulate Coordination</strong>: Experiment with how two or more collectives might align their economic activity without imposing one’s values on the other.</li>
<li><strong>Scale Thoughtfully</strong>: Gradually integrate these systems into real-world cooperatives, learning from their unique needs and priorities.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>This vision isn’t just about technology; it’s about transforming the way we live and work together. It’s a move away from systems that commodify everything toward ones that prioritize care, equity, and sustainability. By blending cutting-edge AI with timeless values of cooperation and mutual aid, we can imagine—and build—a world beyond capitalism.</p>
